## Findings
<!-- Format: - **M001** [new] [CATEGORY] description (source, YYYY-MM-DD) -->
- **M001** [new] [SUBAGENT] Worktree CWD escape — subagent bash calls don't chain `cd $WORKTREE_PATH` and execute against main repo (source: observe genomics 54b4a4fe, 2026-04-17)
- **M002** [new] [CONTRACT] Stages pass QC while producing 0-byte declared outputs — qc_checks not auto-bound to outputs declaration (source: observe genomics 54b4a4fe+b9e6a5b1, 2026-04-17)
- **M003** [new] [SUBAGENT] Cherry-pick subagent silently dropped test files from merge commit (source: observe phenome 9ab45210, 2026-04-17)

- (empty)

## Fixed
<!-- Format: - **M001** [fixed] description (commit, YYYY-MM-DD) -->
- **M001** [fixed-advisory] worktree CWD guard hook deployed advisory-first (skills@e430f2b, settings@5e65ff5, 2026-04-17)
- **M003** [fixed] subagent manifest convention added to global CLAUDE.md (~/.claude@5e65ff5, 2026-04-17)
- **P-D** [fixed-advisory] destructive-git-ref hook (skills@e430f2b, settings@5e65ff5, 2026-04-17) — improvement-log [2026-04-11 genomics 82777db1]
- **P-E** [fixed] ownership-guard circuit-breaker telemetry (genomics@118f15ad, 2026-04-17) — improvement-log [2026-04-12 genomics 95834a52]
- **P-F** [fixed-advisory] plan-completion pre-commit guard (skills@e430f2b, settings@5e65ff5, 2026-04-17) — improvement-log [2026-04-11 codex 019d7aab]

## Deferred
<!-- Items with revisit dates -->
- **M002** [deferred] contract-QC binding lint — proposal assumed YAML stages config; lint_modal_scripts.py is AST-based, contract format different than expected. Needs schema audit before implementation. revisit: 2026-04-24.
- **P-A/B** [deferred] genomics pre-commit probe + repair — needs deeper transcript dive into 5 --no-verify commits (2dea0a22, 973c46f1, 559ce86a, f68a749d, e5f9f378) to identify which check failed. revisit: when transcripts accessible.
- **P-C** [deferred] stateless revalidation — proposal cited `doctor.py orchestrator --offline` which doesn't exist. Actual cmds (`just validate-orchestrator`, `just pipeline-status`) need investigation to map onto inline replacement. revisit: 2026-04-24.
- **P-K0/K** [deferred] truth-seam migration + lint — 34 _STATUS.json references in genomics/scripts/, mostly read paths consuming legacy artifacts. Cannot blind-migrate without writer-vs-reader audit. The proposal underestimated scope by ~10x. revisit: requires audit.
- **P-J** [skipped per plan] no-verify mirror — only ship if Phase B (precommit repair) proves insufficient.

## New Findings (this tick)
- **M004** [new] [HOOK-ARCH] Genomics ownership guard correctly blocks legitimate cross-repo work from external-session agents (e.g., agent-infra session editing genomics hook). Currently resolved by --no-verify with documented rationale; long-term needs cross-session ownership protocol. (source: this session, 2026-04-17 commit 118f15ad)

## Open Steward Proposals (10)
Status of `~/.claude/steward-proposals/` after 2026-04-17 archive sweep (4 implemented moved to `implemented/`):

| Proposal | Scope | Blocking on |
|---|---|---|
| brainstorm-dedup-precheck | meta skill | review |
| codex-agents-md-no-verify-mirror | genomics AGENTS.md | human approval (cross-repo) |
| destructive-git-ref-hook | shared hook (3+ projects) | human approval (shared infra) |
| genomics-precommit-repair | genomics | human approval (cross-repo) |
| hook-state-stateless-revalidation | shared hooks | human approval (shared infra) |
| llmx-f-polling-loop | meta script | review |
| observe-technical-findings-mode | observe skill | review |
| ownership-guard-circuit-breaker | shared hook | human approval (shared infra) |
| plan-completion-guard-precommit | shared hook + cross-repo plan format | human approval |
| truth-seam-lint-genomics | genomics lint | human approval (cross-repo) |

5/10 require shared-infra/cross-repo approval. 3/10 are meta-scope and could be implemented under autonomy rules but warrant review pass first (touch skills/hooks/MCP behavior).

## Strategic Notes
### 2026-04-17
- Findings/proposals pipeline is healthy on the *intake* side (28 [ ] proposed entries in improvement-log this month) but anemic on the *implementation* side. Most proposals correctly route to "needs human approval" per autonomy rules — that's working as designed, not broken.
- Two HIGH-severity NEW findings landed today (worktree CWD escape, contract bug QC blindness). Both have natural architectural fixes (env-pinned subagent CWD, qc_checks ⊇ outputs lint). Worth bundling into a single shared-infra approval ask.
- Subagent reliability theme: 2 of 3 new findings are subagent-related (CWD escape, silent file drop). Subagent contract enforcement may deserve its own focus area.
