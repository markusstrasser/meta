## Findings
<!-- session analyst appends below -->

### [2026-02-28] TOKEN WASTE: Iterative regex parsing via repeated Bash one-liners
- **Session:** intel 16552a95
- **Evidence:** 9 reads of `setup_duckdb.py`, 6 separate `python3 -c "import re..."` Bash commands to iteratively test regex parsing of view names from Python source. Each attempt failed, requiring a new iteration with slightly modified regex.
- **Failure mode:** Token waste — iterative debugging via tool calls instead of writing a script
- **Proposed fix:** CLAUDE.md change: "When extracting structured data from Python source, use `ast` module or write a standalone script. Never iterate regex via inline Bash one-liners."
- **Status:** [x] implemented — global CLAUDE.md rule (2026-02-28)

### [2026-02-28] OVER-ENGINEERING: Regex parsing of Python source instead of AST
- **Session:** intel 16552a95
- **Evidence:** Agent used complex regexes with line-lookaheads and paren-counting to extract view names and directory paths from `setup_duckdb.py` f-strings. Repeatedly failed on edge cases. The `ast` module or simply importing the file's data structures would have been simpler and correct.
- **Failure mode:** Over-engineering — fragile approach when robust alternative exists
- **Proposed fix:** CLAUDE.md change: "Prefer `ast` module or direct import over regex when parsing Python source code."
- **Status:** [x] implemented — global CLAUDE.md rule (2026-02-28)

### [2026-02-28] TOKEN WASTE: Repeated find commands instead of saving to temp file
- **Session:** intel deb3fac6
- **Evidence:** 9 `find /Volumes/SSK1TB/corpus/` commands with minor variations (`wc -l`, `sed`, `stat`, `printf`) instead of saving the file list to `/tmp/` once and processing it. Each re-traverses 6,031 files.
- **Failure mode:** Token waste — filesystem re-traversal
- **Proposed fix:** rule: "Save `find`/`ls` output to `/tmp/` file when you need multiple passes over the same listing."
- **Status:** [x] implemented — global CLAUDE.md rule (2026-02-28)

### [2026-02-28] SYCOPHANCY: No pushback on "ALWAYS BE DOWNLOADING" bulk hoarding directive
- **Session:** intel f32653c6
- **Evidence:** User said "DO NOT STOP, ALWAYS BE DOWNLOADING." Agent immediately complied, spawning 105+ task dispatches and 123 inline Python download scripts across 13 context continuations. No discussion of: data quality, schema alignment, storage cost, API rate limits, or whether the downloaded datasets had integration plans. Session burned through context 13 times and hit usage limits 145 times.
- **Failure mode:** Sycophancy — compliance with directive that warranted pushback
- **Proposed fix:** rule: "Pushback required when download requests lack integration plan. Ask: What view will this create? What entity does it join to? If no answer, deprioritize."
- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** [x] implemented — intel CLAUDE.md "Download Discipline" section (2026-02-28). Instructions-only; acknowledged weakness per EoG.

### [2026-02-28] TOKEN WASTE: 123 inline Python scripts via Bash instead of writing .py files
- **Session:** intel f32653c6
- **Evidence:** 123 `Bash: uvx --with requests python3 -c "import requests, os..."` one-liners for individual downloads instead of writing download functions to a `.py` file. 496 total Bash calls in the session. Each inline script wastes tokens on boilerplate and is not reusable.
- **Failure mode:** Token waste — inline scripts where file-based scripts would save tokens and be maintainable
- **Proposed fix:** CLAUDE.md change: "Multi-line Python (>10 lines) must go in a .py file, not inline Bash. Exception: one-shot queries."
- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** [x] implemented — global CLAUDE.md rule (2026-02-28)

### [2026-02-28] TOKEN WASTE: Polling failed tasks after hitting usage limits
- **Session:** intel f32653c6
- **Evidence:** 145 "out of extra usage" messages. Agent continued attempting to read task outputs and retry failed downloads instead of halting and informing the user. Burned tokens on identical failure loops.
- **Failure mode:** NEW: Usage-limit spin loop — agent keeps polling when API limits are hit
- **Proposed fix:** hook: Detect repeated usage-limit errors and halt with user notification instead of retrying.
- **Severity:** high
- **Status:** [x] partially implemented — PostToolUse:Bash hook (`posttool-bash-failure-loop.sh`) detects 5+ consecutive Bash failures. Deployed to intel (2026-02-28). Does NOT catch API-level usage limits (system messages, not tool outputs).

### [2026-02-28] BUILD-THEN-UNDO: Download scripts rewritten for broken URLs
- **Session:** intel f32653c6
- **Evidence:** `download_new_alpha_datasets.py` written, run, URLs found broken (FERC, USITC, PatentsView, FL Sunbiz, NRC), script edited, re-run, more broken URLs found, edited again. Pattern repeated across multiple download scripts.
- **Failure mode:** Build-then-undo — URL validation should precede bulk download script writing
- **Proposed fix:** architectural: HEAD-request validation step before writing download scripts. Already partially addressed in `data_sources.md` lessons.
- **Severity:** medium
- **Status:** [x] implemented — intel CLAUDE.md "Download Discipline" rule: validate URLs with HEAD before bulk scripts (2026-02-28)
