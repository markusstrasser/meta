### 1. DUPLICATED CONTENT

*   **Recitation Protocol:** *Researcher* (Phase 6b) and *Epistemics* (Recitation Before Synthesis) contain near-identical text regarding Du et al., EMNLP 2025 and the +4% accuracy improvement.
*   **Agent Reliability Research:** *Researcher* (What Research Shows About Agent Reliability) and *Constitution* (Key Research Constraints) share exact citations and summaries for EoG (arXiv:2601.17915), Agent-Diff (arXiv:2602.11224), and ReliabilityBench (arXiv:2601.06112).
*   **Peer Review Martingale:** *Model-Review* (intro) and *Competing-Hypotheses* (Step 2) both quote: "same-model peer review is a martingale — no expected correctness improvement (ACL 2025, arXiv:2508.17536)."
*   **Provenance Tags:** *Researcher* (Provenance Tags) and *Epistemics* (Inference Rules) share the same definitions for `[INFERENCE]`, `[SOURCE]`, and `[UNVERIFIED]`.
*   **Model Selection Tables:** *Model-Guide* (Cost Comparison) and *BENCHMARKS.md* (Pricing) contain identical pricing tables for Claude 4.6, GPT-5.2, and Gemini 3.1.
*   **LLMX Timeout Logic:** *LLMX-Guide* (GPT-5.2 Timeouts) and *PROMPTING_GPT.md* (Effort Levels) duplicate the table mapping reasoning effort to auto-timeout values (120s, 300s, 600s).

### 2. INCONSISTENT MODEL NAMES

*   **Gemini 2.5 vs 3.1:** *Architect* and *Code-Research* cite `gemini-2.5-pro` as the primary model, while *LLMX-Guide*, *Model-Guide*, and *Model-Review* cite `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`.
*   **GPT-5 Pro vs 5.2:** *Architect* and *Code-Research* use `gpt-5-pro`, whereas *LLMX-Guide*, *Model-Guide*, and *Model-Review* use `gpt-5.2`.
*   **Claude Versioning:** *Architect* cites `claude-sonnet-4-5`, while *Model-Guide* and *Model-Review* cite `Claude Sonnet 4.6`.
*   **Kimi Naming:** *Architect* uses `kimi2` and `kimi-k2-thinking`, *LLMX-Guide* uses `kimi-k2.5`, and *Model-Guide* uses `Kimi K2.5`.
*   **Judge vs Model IDs:** *Architect* (Tournament Settings) lists `gemini25-pro` and `claude-4.5`, while its own "Working models" list uses `gemini-2.5-pro` and `claude-sonnet-4-5`.

### 3. STALE REFERENCES

*   **Architect Date:** *Architect* lists "Working models (2025-11-07)" which predates the Feb 2026 release dates cited in *Model-Guide* and *LLMX-Guide*.
*   **Tournament CLI:** *Architect* (Improvements.md) notes the `tournament` CLI is broken and "always exits with status 1," yet the main `SKILL.md` still lists it as a requirement.
*   **Deep-Research Redirect:** *Deep-Research* redirects to `/researcher`, but the *Researcher* skill description does not explicitly state it has absorbed the deep-research functionality.
*   **Gemini 3 Flash Naming:** *LLMX-Guide* warns that `gemini-3-flash` is a 404 and to use `gemini-3-flash-preview`, but *Model-Guide* benchmarks still list it as `Gemini 3.1 Pro` or `Gemini 3 Flash`.
*   **Claude Prefilling:** *PROMPTING_CLAUDE.md* marks prefilling as "DEPRECATED on 4.6," but *Architect* logic (via llmx) still relies on provider-based proposal generation which often uses prefilling for structure.

### 4. MISSING CROSS-REFERENCES

*   **Diagnostics & LLMX:** *Diagnostics* (API-key check) does not reference *LLMX-Guide* for handling the specific timeout behaviors of GPT-5.2 or Gemini 3.1.
*   **Entity-Management & Researcher:** *Entity-Management* (Provenance Rules) does not reference the *Researcher* skill's `fetch_paper` or `save_paper` tools for building the entity's primary source corpus.
*   **Code-Research & Architect:** *Code-Research* (When to Use) does not reference the *Architect* skill for comparing the architectural patterns found in the "best-of" repositories.
*   **Debug-MCP-Servers & Skills:** *Debug-MCP-Servers* does not link to *Architect* or *Researcher*, which are the only skills in the library that explicitly require and define complex MCP tool routing.
*   **Source-Grading & Epistemics:** *Source-Grading* (Axis 1) does not reference the *Epistemics* skill's specific evidence hierarchy for medical/bio claims.

### 5. ANTI-PATTERN DUPLICATION

*   **Confirmation Bias:** Listed in *Researcher* (Anti-Patterns) and *Investigate* (Core Principles).
*   **Precision Fabrication:** Listed in *Researcher* (Phase 5), *Epistemics* (Anti-Hallucination Rules), and *Model-Guide* (The Hallucination Problem).
*   **Adopting Unverified Recommendations:** Listed in *Architect* (Evaluation Criteria) and *Model-Review* (Anti-Patterns).
*   **Ground Truth Neglect:** Listed in *Researcher* (Anti-Patterns) and *Investigate* (Phase 1).

### 6. CONSTITUTIONAL COVERAGE GAPS

*   **Constitutional Awareness Included:** *Architect*, *Constitution*, *Goals*, *Model-Review*, *Researcher*.
*   **Constitutional Awareness Missing:** *Code-Research*, *Competing-Hypotheses*, *Debug-MCP-Servers*, *Diagnostics*, *Entity-Management*, *Epistemics*, *Investigate*, *LLMX-Guide*, *Model-Guide*, *Source-Grading*.
*   **Specific Gap:** *Investigate* and *Competing-Hypotheses* perform high-stakes analysis but do not include the "Constitutional Check" or "Preamble Injection" found in *Model-Review*.
