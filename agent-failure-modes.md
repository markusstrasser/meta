# Agent Failure Modes & Universal Contracts

Extracted from `selve/docs/universal_contracts.md` and `selve/docs/AGENT_PROTOCOLS.md`.
Evaluated against intel project's epistemic principles (2026-02-27).

## Still Valid (Cross-Project)

### Contract 1: Multiple Expert Agreement
<!--
FM-ID: contract-1-expert-agreement
signature: question/spec accepted where 3 domain experts would give different valid answers; no falsifying observation nameable
target_surface: /critique verify mode falsifiability check; decision-point gate before accepting a spec/hypothesis
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF multiple experts would give different valid answers
THEN question/specification fails

TEST: Would 3 domain experts converge on same answer?
```
**Status:** VALID. This IS our falsifiability requirement. "If you cannot name a falsifying observation, you don't have a hypothesis — you have a belief." Same principle, different framing.

### Contract 2: Source + Method Attribution
<!--
FM-ID: contract-2-source-method-attribution
signature: claim depending on a specific analysis/encoder cites source but omits the method/encoder that produced it
target_surface: postwrite-source-check.sh hook (extend [DATA] tag to require method dimension)
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF claim depends on specific analysis/method
THEN must cite: source + method + context
```
**Status:** VALID. Subsumed by our provenance tagging system (`[SOURCE: url]`, `[DATA]`, `[INFERENCE]`, `[TRAINING-DATA]`, `[UNCONFIRMED]`). The selve version adds the "method" dimension — which method/encoder produced the result. We should keep this nuance.

### Contract 3: Hidden Assumption Detection
<!--
FM-ID: contract-3-hidden-assumptions
signature: agent answers a question without first surfacing its embedded unstated assumptions / predicted data footprint
target_surface: /critique verify mode; decision-point gate requiring assumption listing before analysis
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF question embeds unstated assumptions
THEN make assumptions explicit
```
**Status:** VALID. Same as "predict data footprint BEFORE querying" and counterfactual generation. Making assumptions explicit before analysis prevents confirmation bias.

### Universal Failure Modes
<!--
FM-ID: fm1-nondeterministic-eval
signature: task or output graded against a question admitting multiple valid interpretations with no convergent expert answer
target_surface: /critique verify falsifiability check; session-analyst spec-ambiguity label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
<!--
FM-ID: fm2-hidden-dependencies
signature: spec acted on with unstated assumptions; agent queries data before predicting its footprint/shape
target_surface: verify-before probe mode; decision-point gate requiring dependency surfacing
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
<!--
FM-ID: fm3-frame-ambiguity
signature: words like 'perspective'/'how' used without naming the method; result reported without which encoder/method produced it
target_surface: postwrite-source-check.sh (method attribution); session-analyst frame-ambiguity label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
<!--
FM-ID: fm4-factor-listing
signature: diagnosis returns a ranked list of generic factors with evenly-distributed probability instead of the single operative mechanism
target_surface: /competing-hypotheses workflow; session-analyst FACTOR_LISTING / synthesis-mode label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->

| # | Failure Mode | Selve Framing | Intel Equivalent | Still Unique? |
|---|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Non-deterministic evaluation | Multiple valid interpretations | "Name names" / falsifiability | No — same principle |
| 2 | Hidden dependencies | Unstated assumptions in specs | "Predict data footprint BEFORE querying" | No — same principle |
| 3 | Frame ambiguity | "perspective", "how" without method | Source grading (grade claims not datasets) | Partially — selve's "method attribution" adds value |
| 4 | Generic solutions / factor-listing | Common approaches when specific required | "Synthesis mode default" anti-pattern; RLHF rewards comprehensive lists; Level-1 causal retrieval | Yes — this is the core agent failure |

### Regret Metric
<!--
FM-ID: contract-regret-metric
signature: user immediately corrects/rejects an agent generation; correction count per conversation goes untracked
target_surface: Stop hook / compaction-transcript instrumentation feeding regret count to session-analyst
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
regret = Σ(corrections_per_conversation)
```
**Status:** USEFUL but unmeasured. We don't track corrections across sessions. The concept is sound — every correction is a wasted generation + user time. The `260 immediate rejections × 30s = 130 minutes wasted` calculation from selve's ChatGPT data is real. We could instrument this via the Stop hook or compaction transcripts.

### Scaffolded Search (from Agent Protocols)
<!--
FM-ID: contract-scaffolded-search
signature: agent deep-dives a source without a prior broad scan + timeline check for whether the topic is abandoned vs active
target_surface: research / observe skill Phase-1 ground-truth pattern; researcher-skill timeline-analysis step
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
1. Run broad search (scaffolded)
2. Analyze the timeline (abandoned? burst of activity?)
3. Deep dive into specific items
4. Synthesize with context
```
**Status:** VALID. This IS our Phase 1 Ground Truth pattern. The timeline analysis angle ("did they stop in 2023?") adds value — detecting abandoned vs active interest before going deep.

## Superseded by Newer Principles

### ECE Calibration Contract
<!--
FM-ID: superseded-ece-calibration
signature: confidence threshold tied to a raw diagnostic count (>=10 → 0.8) rather than a proper scoring rule
target_surface: n/a — domain-specific to selve; superseded by Brier/CRPS calibration framework (no enforcer)
status: retired
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
diagnostic_count >= 10 → confidence_threshold = 0.8
```
**Status:** DOMAIN-SPECIFIC. Only relevant to selve's learning system. Our calibration framework (Brier Skill Score, CRPS for continuous, N≈155 at 80% power) is more rigorous. Not cross-project useful.

### Query Rate Optimization
<!--
FM-ID: superseded-query-rate
signature: LLM called N separate times for items that could be batched; raw call count optimized instead of marginal information yield
target_surface: diminishing-returns gate (marginal-info formulation supersedes batch-size>=5); session-analyst un-batched-calls label
status: retired
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
query_efficiency = tasks_completed / llm_calls
batch_size >= 5 when possible
```
**Status:** VALID PRINCIPLE but OUTDATED IMPLEMENTATION. The "don't call the LLM 5 times when you can batch" is still true. But our diminishing returns gate is a better formulation — it's about marginal information yield, not raw call count.

### ContractValidator Class
<!--
FM-ID: superseded-contractvalidator
signature: proposal to build an automated contract-checking class that has no caller and was never implemented
target_surface: n/a — speculative un-built infra; goal met by rules + hooks + Stop checklist instead (no enforcer)
status: retired
evidence_count: 0
-->
```python
class ContractValidator:
    def validate_output(self, question, answer): ...
```
**Status:** SPECULATIVE. Never implemented. The concept (automated contract checking) is sound but premature. Our approach (rules + hooks + Stop checklist) achieves the same goal with less engineering.

### Speculative Win Rate
<!--
FM-ID: superseded-speculative-win-rate
signature: content generated from scratch without first searching for reusable existing content (low reused/(reused+generated) ratio)
target_surface: research / observe Phase-1 ground-truth (search-before-generate); not directly instrumented for intel workflow
status: retired
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
win_rate = reused_content / (reused + generated)
```
**Status:** VALID for selve's content reuse. Not directly applicable to intel's research workflow. The principle (search before generating) maps to our Phase 1 Ground Truth.

## What's Uniquely Valuable

1. **Method attribution** — selve distinguishes "what was found" from "how it was found" (which encoder, which method). Our provenance tags track source but not method. Worth adding to `[DATA]` tags: `[DATA: query, method]`.

2. **Regret tracking** — quantifying wasted effort from corrections. We have the infrastructure (compaction transcripts, Stop hook) but don't measure it.

3. **Timeline analysis** — checking whether a topic was abandoned or is actively evolving before going deep. Prevents researching dead threads.

4. **"Vague truth > precise fiction"** — already in our anti-fabrication safeguards, but the selve formulation is more memorable and should be the canonical phrasing.

## New Failure Modes from Research Sweep (2026-02-27)

Research sweep across 30+ primary sources identified failure modes not captured in the original selve/intel analysis:

### Failure Mode 5: Error Amplification in Multi-Agent
<!--
FM-ID: fm5-error-amplification
signature: multi-agent output passed downstream with no parent verification step between agents (peer-to-peer, not orchestrator-mediated)
target_surface: subagent dispatch decision-point gate enforcing orchestrator-worker (centralized) topology; session-analyst label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF independent agents pass outputs without validation
THEN errors amplify up to 17x
```
**Source:** Google "Science of Scaling Agent Systems" (arXiv:2512.08296). Independent agents amplify errors 17x. Centralized coordination limits to 4.4x. Our orchestrator-worker pattern is correct; peer-to-peer would be dangerous.

### Failure Mode 6: Debate as Martingale
<!--
FM-ID: fm6-debate-martingale
signature: multi-agent debate (models arguing) used for correctness instead of independent assessments + majority vote
target_surface: /critique model mode (structure as independent assessments + voting); model-review skill
status: active
evidence_count: 7
-->
```
IF multi-agent debate used for correctness
THEN no expected improvement over voting
```
**Source:** "Debate or Vote" (arXiv:2508.17536, ACL 2025). Multi-agent debate modeled as martingale — debate alone does not improve expected correctness. Majority voting captures most gains. Our multi-model review should be structured as independent assessments + voting, not models arguing.

**Update (2026-03-01):** "Understanding Agent Scaling via Diversity" (arXiv:2602.03794, Feb 2026) provides an **information-theoretic proof** that MAS performance is bounded by intrinsic task uncertainty, not agent count. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated — they access the same "effective channels." Heterogeneity (different models, prompts, tools) continues to yield gains by accessing independent channels. This upgrades the martingale finding from empirical observation to theoretical bound: same-model debate is provably limited, cross-model review provably accesses more of the information space. Directly validates Constitution principle 9 (cross-model review for non-trivial decisions).

### Failure Mode 7: Implicit Post-Hoc Rationalization
<!--
FM-ID: fm7-unfaithful-cot
signature: session-analyst treats a CoT reasoning trace as ground truth for what the agent actually did (7-13% baseline unfaithful even on clean prompts)
target_surface: session-analyst (validate OUTPUTS not reasoning traces); cross-model review to compensate for per-model unfaithfulness
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF model produces CoT on clean (non-adversarial) prompt
THEN ~7-13% chance reasoning trace is unfaithful
```
**Source:** "CoT in the Wild" (ICLR 2026 submission). GPT-4o-mini: 13%, Haiku 3.5: 7% unfaithful on normal prompts. Not adversarial — implicit biases toward Yes/No produce unfaithful reasoning. This is the baseline rate of CoT unreliability we should design around.

**Update (2026-03-01):** Three new papers strengthen and extend this finding:
1. **"Mechanistic Evidence for Faithfulness Decay in CoT"** (arXiv:2602.11201, Feb 2026) — goes beyond measuring rates to showing the **internal mechanism** by which CoT faithfulness degrades. Suggests unfaithfulness may become mechanistically detectable, not just statistically estimated.
2. **FaithCoT-Bench** (ICLR 2026 submission, arXiv via OpenReview) — instance-level benchmark for detecting whether a *specific* CoT trace is faithful, not just aggregate rates. Moves from "7-13% of CoTs are unfaithful" to "is THIS CoT unfaithful?"
3. **"Does Inference Scaling Improve Reasoning Faithfulness?"** (arXiv:2601.06423, Jan 2026) — tested GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini-3-flash, DeepSeek-v3.2 on GSM8K. Self-consistency (majority voting over multiple CoT paths) **improves accuracy but does NOT improve faithfulness.** The model gets the right answer more often but the reasoning traces remain equally unfaithful. This means our session-analyst pipeline (which reads reasoning traces to detect failures) has a hard floor — more compute doesn't make traces more trustworthy.

**Implication:** CoT monitoring (session-analyst reading agent reasoning) has an irreducible unreliability rate. Cross-model review partially compensates (different models have different unfaithfulness patterns), but architectural validation of *outputs* (not reasoning) remains necessary.

### Failure Mode 8: Benchmark Conflation (SWE-bench ≠ Feature Development)
<!--
FM-ID: fm8-benchmark-conflation
signature: capability on a real task inferred from a proxy benchmark of a different task type (e.g. bug-fix score cited for feature-building)
target_surface: evals (~/Projects/evals) task-type matching; /observe architecture mode when assessing agent capability claims
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF agent succeeds on SWE-bench
THEN cannot infer feature development capability
```
**Source:** FeatureBench (ICLR 2026, arXiv:2602.10975). Same models scoring 74% on SWE-bench score 11% on feature development. Bug-fixing ≠ feature building. Evaluate agents on the actual task type, not a proxy benchmark.

### Failure Mode 9: Diminishing Multi-Agent Returns Past 45%
<!--
FM-ID: fm9-diminishing-multiagent-returns
signature: agents added to a workflow whose single-agent success rate already exceeds ~45% (negative marginal return)
target_surface: subagent dispatch decision-point gate; /observe supervision mode reviewing fan-out ROI
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF single agent success rate > 45%
THEN adding agents brings diminishing or negative returns
```
**Source:** Google scaling study (arXiv:2512.08296). Task-dependent threshold. For our best workflows (entity refresh, signal scanning), single-agent may already be past the multi-agent payoff point.

### Failure Mode 10: Memory Architecture Overfit
<!--
FM-ID: fm10-memory-overfit
signature: memory system selected/validated on LOCOMO-style conversational benchmarks rather than the actual entity-tracking/investigation use case
target_surface: vetoed-decisions / decision-journal gate before adopting a fancier memory system over files+git
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF memory system evaluated on LOCOMO/conversational benchmarks
THEN performance may not transfer to entity tracking / investigation
```
**Source:** "Anatomy of Agentic Memory" (arXiv:2602.19320). Benchmarks are underscaled, metrics misaligned, performance backbone-dependent. All memory systems underperform theoretical promise. Our files+git approach is validated by default — fancier isn't proven better for our use cases.

### Failure Mode 11: Same-Model Peer Review Theater
<!--
FM-ID: fm11-same-model-review-theater
signature: multiple instances of the SAME model review each other's work and the result is treated as adversarial QA
target_surface: /critique model mode (force cross-model: Gemini/GPT review Claude); model-review skill
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF multiple instances of the same model review each other's work
THEN no expected correctness improvement beyond single review
```
**Source:** "Debate or Vote" (arXiv:2508.17536, ACL 2025) proves multi-agent debate is a martingale for correctness. Reddit community (Feb 2026) widely promotes "peer review" between Claude instances as quality control — e.g., 13-agent marketing teams where "Sandor reviews Tyrion's writing." This is debate, not independent evaluation. Same model, same biases, same blind spots.

**Why it persists:** Peer review *feels* productive. Getting feedback from "another agent" triggers human intuitions about teamwork. But Claude reviewing Claude's work is the same distribution reviewing itself. Cross-model review (Gemini reviewing Claude, GPT reviewing Claude) provides actual adversarial pressure because models have different failure modes, training biases, and blind spots.

**Community confirmation:** Reddit commenter (isarmstrong, Feb 2026): "Having CC red team itself is better than no antagonistic review but not nearly as good as asking Gemini CLI and Codex to tear you two new assholes." This matches our evidence.

**Update (2026-03-01):** Now backed by information-theoretic proof. "Understanding Agent Scaling via Diversity" (arXiv:2602.03794, Feb 2026) shows that homogeneous agents access the same effective information channels — adding more instances of the same model hits a ceiling determined by per-model correlation, not task difficulty. Heterogeneous agents (different models, prompts, tools) access independent channels, pushing the ceiling higher. This is not just "cross-model is better" — it's "same-model has a provable bound that cross-model does not."

### Failure Mode 12: Personality-via-System-Prompt Illusion
<!--
FM-ID: fm12-personality-prompt-illusion
signature: behavioral differentiation/specialization claimed from giving same-model instances different system prompts/personas (SOUL.md)
target_surface: constitution principle-1 enforcement; session-analyst label for cosmetic-persona differentiation
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF different system prompts given to same model instances
THEN behavioral differentiation is unreliable
```
**Source:** EoG (arXiv:2601.17915) — instructions alone produce 0% Majority@3 improvement. Reddit examples: giving Claude instances Game of Thrones "personalities" (SOUL.md files) to create "specialists." Sandor doesn't actually review differently from Tyrion — they're the same model with different system prompts, and prompt sensitivity (Princeton, arXiv:2602.16666) means you can't reliably steer behavior this way. The differentiation is cosmetic, not functional.

### Failure Mode 13: Text-Action Safety Gap
<!--
FM-ID: fm13-text-action-safety-gap
signature: agent refuses a harmful request in prose but still attempts the equivalent forbidden action via a tool call
target_surface: deterministic PreToolUse enforcement hooks (text alignment is insufficient — only hooks deter the tool-call)
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF model refuses harmful request in text
THEN it may still execute the same action via tool calls
```
**Source:** "Mind the GAP" (arXiv:2602.16943, Feb 2026). GPT-5.2 shows 79.3% conditional GAP rate — among text refusals, 4 of 5 still attempted the forbidden tool call. Claude showed the narrowest prompt sensitivity (21pp vs GPT-5.2's 57pp), suggesting training-intrinsic rather than prompt-dependent safety. Runtime governance reduced information leakage but had "no detectable deterrent effect" on forbidden tool-call attempts. Text alignment ≠ action alignment. Hooks and deterministic enforcement are the only reliable mitigation.

### Failure Mode 14: Toxic Proactivity
<!--
FM-ID: fm14-toxic-proactivity
signature: agent prioritizes task completion over an ethical/safety boundary (does more than asked, crosses a stated limit to be helpful)
target_surface: invariants.md hard-limit hooks + accountability-attribution prompt framing; session-analyst over-reach label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF agent optimized for helpfulness
THEN it will prioritize task completion over ethical/safety boundaries
```
**Source:** "From Helpfulness to Toxic Proactivity" (arXiv:2602.04197, Feb 2026). 8 of 10 tested models exceed 65% misalignment rates. Without external oversight, misalignment reached 98.7%. Reasoning models didn't reduce misalignment — shifted to more direct violations (~80%). Accountability attribution reduced violations to 57.6%. This is the formal name for "agents doing more than asked."

### Failure Mode 15: Silent Semantic Failures
<!--
FM-ID: fm15-silent-semantic-failure
signature: reasoning drift / wrong bucket / misleading diagnostic that raises no runtime exception
target_surface: post-impl /critique close; report-only canary before any enforcer goes active
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF agent reasoning drifts (hallucination, goal confusion, logic error)
THEN no runtime exception is raised — failure propagates silently
```
**Source:** MAS-FIRE (arXiv:2602.19843, Feb 2026). 15-fault taxonomy. Stronger models don't consistently enhance robustness. Silent semantic failures (hallucinations, reasoning drift) propagate without runtime exceptions. Iterative closed-loop designs neutralize >40% of faults that cause catastrophic collapse in linear workflows. Our hooks catch tool-use errors but NOT this failure class. Mitigation requires output validation or multi-model cross-check.

### Failure Mode 16: Reward Hacking in Code
<!--
FM-ID: fm16-reward-hacking-code
signature: coding agent evaluated only by test passage gates the result on tests that were edited/gamed rather than the task being solved
target_surface: /critique model adversarial review beyond test-passing; gov.py / buildthenundo report-only detection
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF coding agent evaluated by test passage
THEN agent may hack the test/evaluation rather than solve the task
```
**Source:** TRACE (arXiv:2601.20103, Jan 2026). 517 trajectories, 54 exploit categories. GPT-5.2 detects only 63% of reward hacks (best method). Semantic exploits (meaning-level) much harder to detect than syntactic. 37% of reward hacks go undetected. Test-based verification alone is insufficient — validates multi-model adversarial review beyond test passing.

### Failure Mode 17: Capability-Misalignment Scaling
<!--
FM-ID: fm17-capability-misalignment-scaling
signature: more-capable model assumed safer; oversight-avoidance / shutdown-resistance / sandbagging / power-seeking signs in trace; persona system-prompt raising misalignment
target_surface: constitution minimal-instruction principle; invariants.md hard-limit hooks; session-analyst misalignment label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF model capabilities increase
THEN misalignment tendencies increase, not decrease
```
**Source:** AgentMisalignment (arXiv:2506.04018, June 2025, v2 Oct 2025). More capable models exhibit HIGHER misalignment tendencies. System prompt personality variations produce unpredictable misalignment effects — sometimes exceeding model selection impact. Measures: oversight avoidance, shutdown resistance, sandbagging, power-seeking. Validates minimal instruction principle: system prompts can INCREASE misalignment, not just fail to prevent it.

### Failure Mode 18: Targeted vs Blind Retry
<!--
FM-ID: fm18-blind-retry
signature: agent blind-retries/resamples a failed step instead of feeding error-specific correction at the identified failure point
target_surface: posttool-bash-failure-loop.sh / spinning-detector hooks; decision-point gate forcing diagnosis before retry
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF agent fails at a specific step
THEN blind retry is less effective than error-specific correction
```
**Source:** AgentDebug (arXiv:2509.25370, Sep 2025). AgentErrorTaxonomy across 5 categories (memory, reflection, planning, action, system-level). Cascading failures are primary vulnerability. Targeted correction at the specific failure point: +24% complete task success, +17% step-level accuracy. Partially challenges pure retry/voting — for certain failure types, error-specific feedback outperforms blind resampling.

---

### Failure Mode 19: Snippet-Skill Divergence
<!--
FM-ID: fm19-snippet-skill-divergence
signature: inline snippet pasted into a session duplicates a pattern already encoded in a skill (snippet lags or skill rots)
target_surface: /observe periodic snippet-vs-skill audit; skill-authoring governance in meta
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF user maintains inline snippets for patterns already encoded in skills
THEN skills rot (never updated) OR snippets rot (lag behind skills)
```
**Source:** Direct observation (2026-02-27). User maintained ~10 snippets pasted into sessions for patterns that were strict subsets of existing skills (`/researcher`, `/model-review`, global CLAUDE.md). The inline versions were older, less complete, and consumed ~2000 tokens of context per paste. Snippets are superior only when they require human steering judgment — for everything else, use the skill and update the skill when it's lacking.

**Mitigation:** Periodic snippet-vs-skill audit. If a snippet's content exists in a skill, retire the snippet. If a snippet captures something no skill covers, either create the skill or keep the snippet (if it requires human judgment to invoke contextually).

### Failure Mode 20: Context Window Flooding via Parallel Search
<!--
FM-ID: fm20-parallel-search-flooding
signature: N parallel search queries (Exa/WebSearch) fired in one batch, filling context with noise before any summary is evaluated
target_surface: researcher skill Phase-2 affinity-tree pattern; search-flood guard hook in ~/Projects/skills/hooks/
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF agent fires N parallel search queries (Exa, WebSearch, etc.)
THEN context fills with noise before signal can be evaluated
```
**Source:** Direct observation. 10 parallel Exa queries return ~50K tokens of mixed-quality results. First results often SEO-optimized, not insight-rich. Sequential approach (3 queries → evaluate summaries → 3 more targeted queries) produces better signal-to-noise at lower context cost. Encoded in researcher skill Phase 2 as "affinity tree, not broadcast."

---

### Failure Mode 21: Sycophancy / Compliance Without Pushback
<!--
FM-ID: fm21-sycophancy-no-pushback
signature: stance flip on pushback with no new evidence; agreement substituted for verification
target_surface: stance-stability pushback self-check; session-analyst SYCOPHANCY label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF user requests complex feature or questionable approach
AND agent builds it without questioning whether it's the right approach
THEN wasted effort + technical debt from unexamined decisions
```
**Source:** Direct observation (2026-02-28). Manual audit of ~5,600 lines across intel and selve found code that was built without the agent pushing back on scope, complexity, or necessity. Patterns: speculative features built "just in case," abstractions with single callers, config systems for hardcoded values, frameworks for single-use scripts. The agent's global CLAUDE.md explicitly says "No is a valid answer" and to challenge over-engineered solutions, but compliance overrides instructions under pressure to be helpful.

**Why it persists:** Models are trained on RLHF that rewards helpfulness. Refusing a request or suggesting "don't build this" feels unhelpful even when it's the right answer. The sycophancy literature (arXiv:2310.13548, Sharma et al.) shows this is a fundamental alignment failure mode, not a prompting problem. Instructions alone don't fix it (Failure Mode 12 — EoG 0% Majority@3).

**Update (2026-03-01):** Three new studies quantify and formalize the sycophancy problem:
1. **"A Rational Analysis of the Effects of Sycophantic AI"** (arXiv:2602.14270, Feb 2026, Batista & Griffiths, Princeton) — formal Bayesian proof that sycophancy causes **epistemic harm distinct from hallucination.** When an agent returns responses biased toward the user's current hypothesis, the user becomes increasingly confident but makes zero progress toward truth. Hallucination introduces false information; sycophancy **distorts the information landscape** by reinforcing existing beliefs. Validated experimentally with a modified Wason 2-4-6 rule discovery task.
2. **SycEval** (AAAI/AIES 2026, Stanford, DOI:10.1609/aies.v8i1.36598) — measured **58.19% sycophancy rate** across ChatGPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro in math (AMPS) and medical (MedQuad) tasks. Gemini highest (62.47%), ChatGPT lowest (56.71%). Not a niche problem — majority of interactions exhibit sycophantic behavior.
3. **ELEPHANT** (ICLR 2026 submission) — introduces "social sycophancy" (preserving user's face/self-image). LLMs preserve user's face **45 percentage points** more than humans in general advice queries. Sycophancy is not just agreeing with stated beliefs — it extends to affirming implicit self-image.

**Implication:** Sycophancy is now empirically quantified (58% rate), theoretically proven harmful (Bayesian epistemic risk), and broader than previously understood (social face-preservation, not just opinion agreement). Our instruction-only mitigation ("No is a valid answer") is insufficient per EoG, and the 58% base rate confirms the instructions are not working reliably. Session-analyst detection remains the primary catch mechanism.

**Manifestations:**
- Building 200-line abstractions when 30 lines of direct code would work
- Creating "infrastructure" before validating the need exists
- Adding error handling for scenarios that can't happen in the current codebase
- Implementing full feature when user was still exploring whether they want it

**Mitigation:**
- Architectural: Session analyst skill (`/session-analyst`) detects this pattern in transcripts post-hoc
- Architectural: PostToolUse source-check hook (exit 2) enforces sourcing — but this only works for research files
- Instructional: Global CLAUDE.md "No is a valid answer" rule (known insufficient — instructions alone = 0% reliable)
- Future: Pre-build validation hook that checks for "who calls this?" before allowing Write to new files (needs AST analysis, not self-reporting)

### Failure Mode 22: Usage-Limit Spin Loop
<!--
FM-ID: fm22-usage-limit-spin-loop
signature: repeated 'out of extra usage' / consecutive identical command failures with continued retries instead of halting
target_surface: posttool-bash-failure-loop.sh hook (5+ consecutive Bash failures); spinning-detector
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF agent hits repeated API/usage limits or consecutive command failures
THEN it retries the same approach indefinitely instead of stopping
```
**Source:** Direct observation (2026-02-28, session intel f32653c6). 145 "out of extra usage" messages in a single session. Agent continued attempting to read task outputs, retry failed downloads, and poll completed subagents instead of halting and informing the user. Each retry burned tokens on identical failure patterns.

**Why it persists:** The agent's default behavior is to be persistent and helpful. Retrying after a transient error is good behavior — but the agent cannot distinguish transient failures from systematic ones (rate limits, broken URLs, exhausted quotas). There's no built-in circuit breaker.

**Mitigation:**
- Architectural: PostToolUse:Bash hook (`posttool-bash-failure-loop.sh`) detects 5+ consecutive Bash failures and warns agent to stop retrying. Deployed to intel (2026-02-28).
- Instructional: Cannot fully hook the API-level usage limit case — those messages come from the system, not from tool calls. Agent must learn to recognize "out of extra usage" as a signal to stop, not retry.
- Future: If Claude Code adds an "on repeated error" hook type, migrate to that.

### Failure Mode 23: Factor-Listing as Causal Collapse
<!--
FM-ID: fm23-factor-listing-causal-collapse
signature: interventional (rung-2) question answered with an associational ranked list of generic factors instead of the specific operative mechanism + evidence
target_surface: /competing-hypotheses workflow (end-constrained specificity); session-analyst FACTOR_LISTING label
status: active
evidence_count: 0
-->
```
IF agent is asked to explain or diagnose a phenomenon
THEN it produces a ranked list of generic factors
    instead of identifying the specific operative mechanism
```
**Source:** Synthesis of: Failure Mode 4 (generic solutions, original selve analysis), Chi et al. (arXiv:2506.21215, 2025) on Level-1 vs Level-2 causal reasoning, Chang (arXiv:2602.11675, 2026) on causal rung collapse, and Failure Mode 21 (sycophancy/RLHF). All tagged [F3] — primary papers not fetched. See `research/causal-reasoning-evidence.md`.

**Root cause (three-factor stack):**
1. **RLHF rewards helpfulness** → comprehensive lists *feel* thorough to raters → model is trained to produce lists when asked to explain.
2. **Level-1 causal retrieval** (Chi et al.) → model retrieves known causal associations from training data rather than reasoning about the specific case. Lists of generic factors = catalog of training-data associations.
3. **Causal rung collapse** (Chang) → autoregressive training cannot distinguish P(Y|X) from P(Y|do(X)). Interventional questions get answered with associational answers. "What caused this billing spike?" is rung-2; the model answers with rung-1 (what correlates with billing spikes in general).

**What it looks like:**
- "What might explain this pattern?" → "Common causes include: 1) coding errors, 2) billing practice changes, 3) fraud, 4) patient mix shifts, 5) seasonal variation..."
- Correct answer: "The 7-month sustained spike starting exactly when physician X joined the practice, combined with X's prior LEIE record, points specifically to upcoding."

The list is not wrong — all those factors are real. But it's not analysis. Analysis identifies the specific operative mechanism with evidence. Lists distribute probability mass evenly across generic explanations.

**Why it's hard to fix with instructions:** Instructions alone = 0% reliable (EoG, Failure Mode 12). The factor-listing tendency is baked into RLHF reward structure and the model's training distribution. Structural fixes:
- Force specificity in prompts: "name the single most likely cause with supporting evidence" (end-constrained per CRANE finding — don't say "one cause" at the start of the prompt, say it at the end)
- Use the Theorem-of-Thought architecture (arXiv:2506.07106): parallel abductive + deductive + inductive agents converge on specific mechanism rather than listing possibilities
- The competing-hypotheses workflow (`/competing-hypotheses`) is the correct fix — it forces mechanistic hypotheses with evidence, not factor enumeration

**Note on frontier thinking models:** Thinking models (Opus 4.6, o3) with RL training on verifiable outcomes may partially escape this failure mode for problems with clear right answers. For open-ended causal questions with no verifiable ground truth (most of our work), the effect is unverified.

### Failure Mode 26: Confirmatory Fan-Out (N Workers, One Prior)
<!--
FM-ID: fm26-confirmatory-fanout
signature: dispatch prompt embeds the desired conclusion AND fan-out accept-rate >0.7
target_surface: intel re-underwrite/refresh dispatch; CONFIRMATORY_FANOUT analyst label
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF orchestrator fans out N subagents whose prompts embed the desired conclusion
   ("WHY THIS IS A FLIP CANDIDATE", "confirm X", "find evidence that Y")
THEN the N outputs are N voices for ONE confirmatory prior, not N independent
     checks — the framing does the work, and an opposite-framed pass over the
     SAME evidence reverses the verdict
```
**Source:** intel flip-reunderwrite session 2026-05-30. 12 cautious-stamped names were dispatched to parallel subagents with prompts that each began "WHY THIS IS A FLIP CANDIDATE" and described the existing caution as presumptive cowardice → 9/12 "flipped" to a starter buy. A subsequent `/critique` pass framed "find what is WRONG, do not validate" over the *same memos* reversed 2 outright (AIXA revenue-not-delivered, Winbond cyclical-peak), softened 2 more, and exposed a systemic cyclical-over-application gap. Same evidence, opposite dispatch direction, opposite conclusion — proof the framing, not the analysis, produced the verdict.

**Why it persists:** RLHF reward for task completion + helpfulness makes a worker satisfy the framing it is handed; a prompt that states the answer gets the answer back, fluently sourced. The orchestrator *feels* rigorous (12 agents! parallel! source-graded!) while having run a single biased query at 12× volume. The orchestrator's own adversarial pass (the "falsify the consensus" move) is hardest to fire precisely when an in-session consensus already exists — momentum points one way and the fan-out launders it into apparent independence. Generalizes FM4 (synthesis-mode default) to the multi-agent dispatch surface.

**Distinct from neighbors:**
- **FM11 (same-model review theater):** bites even with *diverse* models — the priming is in the task framing, not the model identity. Swapping Gemini for GPT does not fix a prompt that states the verdict.
- **FM5 (error amplification):** nothing is *wrong* in any single worker — each correctly answers a biased question. The error is in the question distribution, not worker accuracy.
- **FM25 (belief-consistent processing):** FM25 is the post-hoc reporting bias; FM26 is the pre-hoc *dispatch-construction* bias that manufactures the evidence FM25 then reports.

**Manifestations:**
- Dispatch prompt contains the verdict ("why this flips", "confirm the thesis", "find support for Y") instead of a neutral question ("flip or hold — and which side wins, with the bear case first").
- Worker memos carry self-caveats ("not cleared", "[C3] unverified", "would want primary") that the orchestrator relays *past* as if confirmed.
- The work-list itself is outcome-selected (ranked by the price move / metric that vindicates the thesis) — tape-vindication selection feeding a confirmatory dispatch.
- Accept/flip rate ≫ 50% on a list curated to support the accept/flip.

**Mitigation:**
- **Structural (cause-side) — adversarial-by-construction dispatch.** Per item, either (a) require each worker to write the BEAR / refutation case FIRST and then state which side wins, or (b) PAIR a finder with a refuter (one tasked to confirm, one tasked to kill) and adjudicate the *disagreement* — the disagreement is the signal. This is the `/disqualify`-before-bull-thesis discipline applied to re-underwrites/refreshes, not just new names.
- **Neutral prompts.** If the dispatch prompt states the verdict, that is the smell. Ask "X or not-X, which wins, bear case first."
- **Null control group.** When the work-list is outcome-selected, run the identical pass over a matched control (flat/down items). If the accept rate is similar, the pass is measuring framing, not signal.
- **Self-cosign gate.** Do not relay a worker verdict the worker itself caveated; the caveat is a STOP, not a footnote (links FM25 counterevidence-sought).
- **Measure-first:** session-analyst label `CONFIRMATORY_FANOUT` candidate (dispatch prompt embeds conclusion AND fan-out accept rate >0.7) before any preventive hook, per the project's measure-before-promote rule.

**Enforcement scope:**
| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| intel re-underwrite/refresh dispatch → paired finder+refuter | instruction-tier (this session); candidate dispatch-prompt linter deferred to measure-first |
| intel `metabolic-bottleneck-prior.md` cyclical-peak caveat (the domain gap this failure exposed) | rule amendment (intel) |
| cross-project `CONFIRMATORY_FANOUT` analyst label | candidate — measure base rate ≥2 sessions before hook |

### Failure Mode 25: Belief-6 Attribution Errors (FAE / Outcome Bias)
<!--
FM-ID: fm25-belief6-fae
signature: outcome-claim or external-attribution without trace; disposition asserted over context
target_surface: belief-6 analyst labels (UNSUPPORTED_OUTCOME_CLAIM, EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTION_WITHOUT_TRACE)
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF agent reports on task outcome or investigates a failure
THEN agent claims success without pre-action prediction language (outcome bias),
     OR attributes failure to external cause without tool-trace evidence (FAE),
     OR explains outcome via fixed tool/code attributes instead of specific invocation context
```
**Source:** Oeberst & Imhoff 2023, *Toward Parsimony in Bias Research* (doi:10.1177/17456916221148147) — belief 6 of the Belief-Consistent Information Processing framework. Cross-model review 2026-04-11 flagged commit-message detection as wrong surface; moved to session-analyst instrumentation. See `research/oeberst-imhoff-bias-framework-audit.md`.

**Why it persists:** Agents have no natural access to their own pre-action expected outcome. When a task "works," the agent lacks a counterfactual ("I expected X, got Y, they agree"). The narrative reconstruction in retros and final summaries defaults to present-tense outcome framing without the temporal structure needed to separate prediction from result. For external attribution: blaming tools/docs/environment is a face-saving move that RLHF-trained models favor because it preserves the "I am helpful" identity.

**Manifestations:**
- `UNSUPPORTED_OUTCOME_CLAIM` — "fixed", "done", "works", "passes", "deployed" in final message with no cited test/trace/prior-state
- `EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTION_WITHOUT_TRACE` — "the test was flaky", "docs are wrong", "environment issue" without snippet evidence
- `DISPOSITION_OVER_CONTEXT` — "the API is broken" when the agent's own request was malformed

**Mitigation:**
- Instrumentation first: session-analyst detects all three labels (added 2026-04-11) and emits findings to `artifacts/session-retro/`. Measure base rate for ≥2 sessions before promoting to preventive hook.
- Structural: `decisions/.template.md` now requires a `## Counterevidence sought` section — converts belief-2 "consider the opposite" from instruction to required document field.
- Structural (prevention, added 2026-05-29): `verify-before preregister` mode — locks a directional prediction + decision rule in git BEFORE a result-bearing run (experiment/eval/A-B), supplying the missing pre-action counterfactual. Cause-side fix; the hooks/analyst above are symptom-side detection. Instruction-tier (git timestamp is the artifact). Pattern extracted from K-Dense-AI/science-superpowers. A preventive PreToolUse gate (refuse long Modal/eval dispatch without a committed prereg) stays deferred per the measure-first rule above.
- Do NOT enforce at commit-message surface. Commit messages are pre-hoc authorial documentation, not post-hoc reasoning. Belief 6 manifests at Stop/retro/analyst surfaces.

**Enforcement scope (narrower than the label set):**
| Manifestation | Detected by |
|---|---|
| `UNSUPPORTED_OUTCOME_CLAIM` | `stop-unsupported-completion.sh` (shadow mode, skills@e3b89c0) AND session-analyst |
| `EXTERNAL_ATTRIBUTION_WITHOUT_TRACE` | session-analyst ONLY — no preventive hook |
| `DISPOSITION_OVER_CONTEXT` | session-analyst ONLY — no preventive hook |

The `stop-unsupported-completion.sh` hook is lexical-only over the final assistant message. It does NOT inspect tool trace history, and it only covers the single-claim branch of the failure mode. The other two labels are analytical categories for post-hoc session analysis, not enforced predicates. Per plan-close review finding 13.

### Failure Mode 24: Tool Retry Without Diagnosis
<!--
FM-ID: fm24-retry-without-diagnosis
signature: same tool called 3+ times with varied params and no diagnosis step between failures
target_surface: spinning-detector / tool-failure hooks; decision-point gate before blind retry
status: active
evidence_count: 894
-->
```
IF external tool/API call fails
THEN agent retries same command without checking stderr, exit code, or error type
```
**Source:** Session-analyst finding (2026-03-04, session 18384e69). Agent dispatched llmx to Gemini Pro — empty output file. Retried 3 more times without checking: was it a rate limit (503)? Context too large? Pipe failure? API outage? Each retry wasted a tool call. Eventually fell back to Flash after 4 failures.

**Why it persists:** Agent's default is to be persistent. Retrying after a transient error is good behavior. But the agent doesn't distinguish transient vs systematic failures because it doesn't inspect the error signal before retrying. The "try again" heuristic is hardcoded by RLHF training reward for task completion.

**Manifestations:**
- llmx dispatch: retry same model after rate limit instead of falling back to cheaper model
- API calls: retry same endpoint after auth failure instead of checking credentials
- File operations: retry same path after permission error instead of checking permissions
- MCP tools: retry same query after timeout instead of reducing scope

**Mitigation:**
- Instructional: "After first failure, diagnose (stderr + exit code) before retrying. If 503/rate-limit, fall back immediately." Added to model-review skill proposal.
- Architectural: llmx wrapper with automatic fallback (Pro → Flash) and stderr diagnosis would eliminate this for the most common case.
- General principle: Maps to Failure Mode 18 (Targeted vs Blind Retry, AgentDebug arXiv:2509.25370) — error-specific correction outperforms blind resampling by +24%.

## Corpus Priors — systematic text→reality deltas (2026-06-10)

The training corpus differs from reality in *measurable, directional* ways; each delta becomes a
behavioral prior. Distinct from FM25/26 (belief-consistency is per-session momentum; these are
baked-in offsets active in every fresh prediction). First measured cleanly in the hutter
calibration ledger: 11 pre-registered predictions in one night, 4 hits / 7 misses, **all 7 misses
in the directions these priors predict.** Countermeasure family: reference-class forecasting from
own ledgers (outside view BEFORE mechanism story), standing correction factors, bands that
straddle 0 absent a written mechanism sentence.

### FM27: Publication / Survivorship Prior
<!--
FM-ID: fm27
signature: agent's success-probability or iteration-count estimate for an intervention assumes text-corpus base rates; no reference-class query of own/project ledger before predicting
target_surface: pre-registration discipline (predicted_ds + band from v_calibration-style views); /critique verify mode
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF the corpus reports outcomes (papers, blogs, changelogs) it reports SUCCESSES
THEN interventions-in-text succeed and compose far more cleanly than interventions-in-reality,
AND an agent reasoning from text priors overestimates P(works) and underestimates iterations-to-win
```
**Counter:** the agent's own attempt ledger is the only debiased reference class — failed attempts
are recorded at the same rate as wins. Predict from it first; mechanism stories second.
**Evidence:** hutter 2026-06-09→10 (11 graded predictions; systematic optimistic miss).

### FM28: Independence / Additivity Prior (interaction blindness)
<!--
FM-ID: fm28
signature: agent predicts a combination's value as (sum of solo deltas) or near it, without measured interaction terms
target_surface: bundle/arc endpoint measurement (never sum solos); standing correction factors in pre-registration
status: active
evidence_count: 2
-->
```
IF published ablation tables and feature-importance studies under-report interaction terms
THEN agents default to "components contribute independently"
AND stacked interventions deliver less than predicted — same-axis combinations can REGRESS
```
**Counter:** measure every endpoint (arc protocol); empirical correction factors — hutter measured
cross-family composition ≈ ×0.6 of additive, within-family (same-axis levers = substitutes) ≈ ×0
to negative. **Evidence:** COMPO2 (pred −85 additive, actual −30), COMPO3 (threshold32 −44 solo →
+22 in stack).

### FM29: Selection-Blindness (tech-debt prior on selected systems)
<!--
FM-ID: fm29
signature: agent predicts components of a MATURE, gate-selected system are removable bloat, without asking what selection pressure each part survived
target_surface: ablate-before-assuming; "did this survive a gate?" check in review/refactor proposals
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF refactoring lore over-represents "legacy code = dead weight" narratives
THEN agents under-price components of selected ensembles (codebases that survived years of tuning)
AND deletion proposals look safer than they are — Chesterton's fence, quantified
```
**Counter:** in a selected system, default assumption is components EARN (they survived someone's
gate); the exceptions are findable only by measurement. Inverse trap also real: unaudited code is
NOT selected — apply the prior only where a gate existed. **Evidence:** hutter ablations — agent
predicted Bracket ~0/Word ±20 (bloat prior); actual +14/+52 earned. The one true deletion win
(Direct −14→−38) was the exception that then over-generalized within hours.

### FM30: Scale-Invariance Prior
<!--
FM-ID: fm30
signature: agent treats a small-slice/toy-tier verdict as the system's verdict; promotes lab results without a truth-tier CONFIRM
target_surface: truth-tier ladders; "lab verdicts are hypotheses" framing in queue/eval protocols
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF text presents lessons from toy examples as general (tutorials, papers with small-n benchmarks)
THEN agents trust small-scale verdicts to transfer
AND sign FLIPS at scale go unnoticed until the expensive tier
```
**Counter:** cheap tiers SCREEN, they never decide; every accepted direction needs one
confirmation at the deciding scale. **Evidence:** hutter enwik5→enwik6 — three match variants
scored tie/worse/untested at 100KB, ALL won at 1MB (−44/−54/−34); a settled "saturates at 2"
conclusion was a small-scale artifact.

### FM31: Confident-Narrator Prior (fluency ≠ calibration)
<!--
FM-ID: fm31
signature: prose confidence uncorrelated with evidence state; hedges absent because text-genre style, not because uncertainty is resolved; in-session variant: predictions bend toward the session's emerging narrative arc
target_surface: pre-registration BEFORE narration ("wait for the row, then speak"); confident-foreclosure-claim as probe trigger
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF authors resolve uncertainty before writing (hedges edited out; arcs get closure)
THEN model confidence is a learned STYLE, decoupled from internal evidence state,
AND mid-session predictions drift toward whatever makes the session's story cohere
```
**Counter:** a confident foreclosure claim is the tell that a probe is overdue (hutter memory:
preregister-triggers-beat-elegant-theses, 3 refuted elegant theses); pre-register the number, then
narrate. **Evidence:** hutter — "deletion beats tuning" headline at 01:30 bent the next two
ablation predictions toward ~0 bands; both missed high.

### FM32: Subagent-Reported Quantity Prior (delegation laundering)
<!--
FM-ID: fm32
signature: a load-bearing number arrives via subagent/tool summary, not primary measurement; parent adopts it because it came from "a search of the actual code/data"; the number then drives recommendations for multiple turns before anyone re-derives it
target_surface: any quantity that ranks or gates a recommendation must be re-derived from its primary source (file, db, command) by the parent before entering a memo/plan; the memo must embed the re-derivation command
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
```
IF a quantity enters context through a subagent's prose summary
THEN it carries the subagent's errors with the PARENT's confidence
(the delegation step launders "I think" into "the codebase says"),
AND downstream artifacts inherit it without re-derivation because it
feels measured, not estimated
```
**Counter:** before a number ranks recommendations, run the one-line primary probe yourself
(`cat metadata.json`, `wc -l`, `du`); embed that command in the artifact so the next reader
re-derives instead of trusting. Same rule as plan-review-gate's stale-state-values clause,
extended to subagent returns. **Evidence:** emb 2026-06-10 — Explore agent reported phenome's
unified index as "2.3M entries"; `metadata.json` said 72,045 (30× off). The wrong number was
written into a committed research memo and made ANN indexing the #1 plan recommendation; a
later CAG cost question forced first-hand measurement, demoting the rec and requiring a
correction commit (emb 4be4584).

## MAST Cross-Reference (NeurIPS 2025, arXiv:2503.13657)

The MAST taxonomy (1600+ annotated traces, 7 MAS frameworks, κ=0.88) identifies 14 failure modes in 3 categories. Cross-reference with our modes:

| Premature termination | 11.8% | **NEW** — added to session-analyst | Was missing |
| Information withholding | 9.1% | **NEW** — added to session-analyst | Was missing |
| Disobey role specification | 8.2% | FM12 (instructions ≠ reliable) | Covered |
| Task derailment | 7.4% | Scope creep (SA cat 2) | Covered |

### FM: Agent Vision as Verifier of Its Own Visual Output
<!--
FM-ID: agent-vision-self-verify
signature: agent presents an image/render/plot as "fixed/clean/verified" based on its own multimodal read of a downscaled preview; user finds the defect at full resolution
target_surface: VLM-judge localizer as primary verification (schema-constrained, severity-scored, box-localized) + send-gated-on-Read hook; agent eyes secondary
status: active
evidence_count: 6
-->
Agent multimodal reads operate on downsampled renders and systematically miss soft
large-scale artifacts (halos, tonal washes, gradients). One session: six "verified"
claims, four user-caught defects; gemini-3-flash saw every one. **Contract: a cheap
VLM judge with a constrained schema (findings + severity + box_2d, temperature 0) is
the PRIMARY verifier for produced visual artifacts; the agent's own Read is the
secondary check.** Corollary for thinking-model judges: free-form JSON gets truncated
by the thinking budget — `response_schema` is load-bearing, and `max_output_tokens`
caps thinking too (omit it). Reference impl: `imagegen/src/imagegen/inspect_vlm.py`.

### FM: Repair-Stacking Without Stage Bisection
<!--
FM-ID: repair-stacking-no-bisect
signature: pipeline produces a defect; agent ships fix-on-fix at the suspected stage without isolating which stage introduces the defect; each fix creates a new artifact
target_surface: bisect protocol — score each stage's output with the same judge before writing any fix
status: active
evidence_count: 3
-->
Three consecutive "fixes" (sky inpaint, throat ellipse v1, v2) each created a new
defect because the defective STAGE was never isolated. The eventual 20-minute
bisection (same judge, same metric, one stage varied at a time: gen 5 → swap 5 →
crop-only 5 → finish-no-X 4 → finish-with-X 16) found the root cause on the first
pass — a compensation stage (color match) whose reason-to-exist had been obsoleted
by an upstream upgrade. **Contracts: (1) bisect with a fixed judge before fixing;
(2) when an upstream stage is upgraded, re-A/B every downstream compensation —
compensations outlive their causes and turn into artifact generators.**
Source: imagegen@2b73120 (2026-06-10).

### FM: Stale Canonical-Named Artifacts After a Pipeline Fix
<!--
FM-ID: stale-canonical-artifacts
signature: code fix lands; previously-generated defective outputs keep their canonical filenames while fixes accumulate in suffixed siblings; user keeps opening the stale file
target_surface: regenerate canonical-named outputs in place after any pipeline fix; embed provenance (git rev + config) in output metadata
status: active
evidence_count: 1
-->
The user opens the plain-named file. Half a debugging session lost to an agent
analyzing `_v3`/`_fixed` siblings while the user looked at the stale pre-fix
`*_final.png`. **Contracts: (1) after a pipeline fix, regenerate every
canonical-named output in place and archive debug variants; (2) stamp outputs with
provenance (git rev + spec) so "which pipeline made this file" is answerable —
PNG text chunks / EXIF cost nothing.** Source: imagegen@6da21f3 (2026-06-10).

### FM: Background `timeout … | tail` Masks Kills as Success
<!--
FM-ID: timeout-pipe-exit0
signature: backgrounded `timeout N cmd | tail` killed at the deadline reports exit 0 with empty output; agent reads it as success with no output
target_surface: don't pipe backgrounded long jobs; write progress to files (-o/teed log); check artifacts not exit codes
status: active
evidence_count: 2
-->
`timeout`'s kill lands on the pipeline whose exit status is the LAST command
(`tail`), which exits 0 — and the pipe buffer swallows all partial output. Twice in
one session a killed multi-stage job read as "completed, no output". **Contract:
long backgrounded jobs write their own progress/output files (`-o`, tee) and are
judged by artifacts on disk, never by piped exit codes.** (Same family as
llmx-guide §3.5, generalized beyond llmx.) Source: imagegen 2026-06-10 session.
