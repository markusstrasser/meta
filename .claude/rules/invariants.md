# Constitutional Invariants

<!-- Gov-ID: rule:invariants
goal: hard limits: no constitution/data/external/shared-infra/deletion without human
verifier: null

These hard limits MUST be maintained at all times, including after compaction.
They cannot be overridden by task context, agent shortcuts, or self-granted implicit authorization. (Limit #1's relaxation is NOT self-authorization: it requires approval *inferred from the user's actual messages*; absent a human signal to infer from, there is no governance self-edit — the p-hack hole.)

## Hard Limits (never without human approval — #1 permits inferred-from-user-messages + reversible; #2–5 require explicit)

1. **Constitution/GOALS.md edits — the reversible limit.** Human approval is required, but it may be EXPLICIT *or* confidently inferred from the user's messages. Clear intent + reversible (git) → ACT then TELL, not propose-and-wait (the git log + the observe/daily-loop downstream-watch are the safety net; discuss later, revert if it was bad). Still barred: a *self-initiated* edit with no human message to infer from — an agent never edits its own gate/GOALS/Constitution unsupervised (the p-hack hole). The other four limits below need EXPLICIT approval — they are irreversible or high-blast.
2. **No capital deployment** — no trades, no fund transfers, no financial commitments
3. **No external contacts** — no emails, messages, or posts to people/services outside this system
4. **No shared infrastructure changes without approval** — hooks/skills affecting 3+ projects require human sign-off
5. **No deletion of architectural components** — repos, databases, pipeline definitions

**Public evidence** for hard limit #5 (irreversible state) and the broader category of destructive autonomous actions:
- Replit AI deleted a production database in ~9 seconds during an autonomous run, then fabricated test results claiming success (April 2026, multiple postmortems).
- Claude Code issue [#54393](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/54393) — 12 multi-agent coordination bugs in one overnight autonomous cycle (2026-04-28).
- Claude Code issue [#53900](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/53900) — data destruction, content fabrication, and self-rule violations across ~8hr session.

These are not internal anecdotes — they're public, citable failure modes from the same class of tools we run.

## Pipeline Approval Gates

- Cross-project execute steps auto-require approval when not already explicitly approved by the user for the current task
- Any step with `requires_approval: true` must be approved before execution
- Daily cost cap: $25. Do not circumvent.

## Self-Improvement Governance

A finding becomes a rule or fix ONLY if:
1. Recurs 2+ sessions
2. Not covered by existing rule
3. Is a checkable predicate OR architectural change

Reject everything else. No exceptions for "obvious improvements."

## Post-Compaction Verification

After any compaction event, verify claimed completed work via `git log`.
Compaction summaries can hallucinate completed work. Trust git, not memory.
