"""Test-health sentinel — watch whether each repo's test suite still COMPLETES.

A non-completing suite produces NO regression signal, and a single flaky hard
crash can silently disable the entire suite for days. It did: a certificates
SIGSEGV (~2/20) aborted `pytest tests/` and masked FOUR clusters of cross-repo
contract drift for ~6 days (2026-06-01). `doctor.py` checks hooks/config; nothing
watched whether the suites themselves run. This is that watcher — the
error-correction loop's self-monitor.

Local, zero-API, report-only. For each configured repo it runs the suite (slow
tests excluded) under a timeout and records, appended to
``~/.claude/test-health.jsonl`` for trend:

  outcome ∈ {passed, failed,                      # COMPLETED — normal signal
             collection_error, internal_error,    # DID NOT COMPLETE — high signal
             usage_error, no_tests, crashed, timeout}

The load-bearing distinction is COMPLETED vs DID-NOT-COMPLETE: "5 failed" is a
normal regression you'll see anyway; "crashed / collection_error / timeout" means
the suite can't even produce a verdict — the blind spot this exists to catch.

Run: ``just test-health`` (or the daily launchd job com.agent-infra.test-health).
