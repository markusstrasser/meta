# 2026-06-04: Consumption over autonomy — two governance refinements + one unification

## What prompted this
A session that (a) inverted the "300 orphan tools" framing into a lint-blindness
fix, (b) ran the verifier-bound eval (cross-lab gate NOT justified at seeded-defect
difficulty — count-delta suffices), and (c) dogfooded the investing "knowability
loop" on a real memory divergence (intel research/2026-06-04_nand_coverage_gap).
Three unrelated workstreams surfaced the **same** failure and the **same**
mismatch.

## Finding 1 — The cross-cutting disease is generation-without-consumption
The system is good at GENERATING (research, detectors, signals, theses) and poor
at CONSUMING (converting them into decisions/positions/fixes). Evidence, now ≥4
instances across repos:
- corpus drift audit fired daily (exit 1) into a void for weeks (2026-06-03 incident).
- source_eval resolve-heartbeat FAILed daily, unconsumed (intel/genomics diagnosis).
- orphan lint was 65% false-positive — noise that trains agents to ignore it.
- **intel memory thesis: NAND ASP +292% was in the book's OWN 2026-05-24 notes;
  no NAND pure-play was ever added to coverage; SK Hynix stayed WATCHLIST 0%
  through ~+30%.**

This generalizes the verifier-bound thesis: **a verifier (or detector, or
research finding) with no consumer is equivalent to no verifier.** Generation is
cheap with agents; consumption is the bottleneck. The waste to hunt is not tool
sprawl or lint noise (symptoms) — it is unconsumed generation (the disease).

**PROPOSED constitutional principle (human-gated):** add a *Consumption* principle —
every detector/generator must name its consumer; unconsumed generation is the
primary measured waste; "fires into a void" is a defect class, not a nuance.
Operationalized by the consumed-alert spine in Finding 3.

## Finding 2 — The autonomy metric is the wrong yardstick for the judgment-coupled core
The Generative Principle ("maximize the rate of declining supervision") is correct
for *systematizable* work (the part machines can close a loop around). It is
**backwards** for the judgment-coupled core — secular-technology / compounding
investing (Thiel/Aschenbrenner archetype, which is what intel actually is: the
AI-buildout/power/compute book). There the point is *high* human-judgment coupling
on a few deep calls; the human (taste for durable trajectories, conviction to sit
still) is the irreplaceable input and the fleet's job is to *feed* judgment, not
replace it. Autonomy-maximization structurally pulls toward the systematizable
13%-with-fees grinder and away from the few deep bets that actually compound.

**PROPOSED GOALS/constitution refinement (human-gated):** split work into two
regimes with different metrics —
- **AUTOMATE-able** (mechanical, verifiable): metric = declining supervision (unchanged).
- **AMPLIFY-able** (judgment-coupled: theses, secular-tech calls, taste): metric =
  *depth of judgment per decision* + *consumption rate of generated signal*, NOT
  declining supervision. Keep the human in the loop by design; measure whether the
  fleet deepened the call, not whether it removed the human.

> **[2026-06-07 — GENERALIZED + APPLIED]** Ratified and generalized into
> `2026-06-07-verifier-conditional-autonomy` (applied to the constitution with
> Markus's approval). Changes from the form above: (1) discriminator is **verifier
> quality, not domain** — keys on whether a clear ground-truth verifier exists,
> generalizing past investing to writing/art/STEM. (2) **Third regime added**
> (partial/noisy/delayed → bounded autonomy) — the two-way split was a false binary
> (cross-model review). (3) The "consumption rate" *maximand* is **replaced** — as
> worded it incentivizes flooding the human; the live metric is principal-attention
> *efficiency*, with consumption kept only as a *floor* (no generation without a
> named consumer). Findings 1 and 3 remain PROPOSED.

## Finding 3 — Unify: one consume-or-escalate spine, not N detectors-into-void
The three loops (corpus drift, orphan GC, investing knowability) are one pattern:
detect divergence → post-mortem (noise / real / knowable) → upgrade the model.
Today each is bespoke and most fire into a void.

**Sketch (within meta autonomy to prototype; not yet built):** make `consumed-alert`
first-class shared infra — every detector routes its signal to a named consumer and
emits a *consumption receipt*; signals unconsumed past a threshold escalate (to a
human surface), they don't silently expire. This SIMPLIFIES by replacing N
detector-into-void patterns with one spine, and it is the operational form of
Finding 1. Pre-existing pending item ("make audit_corpus_sync abandoned_total
exit-affecting + routed to a consumer") is the first instance.

## What is NOT proposed
- No edit to constitution/GOALS without human sign-off (hard limit).
- No new scored-quality gate (vetoed 2026-06-01) — consumption is a routing/receipt
  property, not a composite score.
- No mass tooling rebuild — the spine wraps existing detectors.

## Pre-registered test
If the Consumption principle + spine are adopted: within 30 days, every standing
detector (corpus drift, source_eval, orphan lint, divergence) has a named consumer
and a non-void escalation path; zero "fired daily into a void for weeks" incidents
recur.

## Update 2026-06-14 — third axis observed: telemetry streams (cleanup-grade, NOT detector-grade)

Swept all ~30 `~/.claude/*.jsonl|*.json` telemetry/state streams for the disease (writer exists, zero readers). Result: **~28 consumed, 2 zombies** — `steward-actions.jsonl` (53K, eradicated-orchestrator residue) and `spinning-shadow.jsonl` (1.2M, writer hook removed). Both deleted.

**Root cause is not "no detector" — it is removal-without-teardown:** when a hook/job/script writer is deleted, its output file (and any downstream consumer edge) is left behind to rot. The disease now has three observed axes — code (`orphan_check`), findings (`orphan_findings`), telemetry (here).

**Decision: do NOT build a third (telemetry) orphan detector.** 2 zombies / 30 streams is cleanup-grade, not leak-grade (resist-list discipline, 2026-06-14 session). The durable fix is the teardown discipline, not more standing detectors: **removing a generator must remove its orphaned output in the same change** (grep the writer's output path; delete what no longer has a writer). If telemetry zombies recur (a 3rd appears), reconsider a check then — measure before enforcing.
